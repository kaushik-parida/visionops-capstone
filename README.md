# InsightSSD Workplace Detector

InsightSSD Workplace Detector is an interactive object detection dashboard and deep learning laboratory designed for professional office automation, workplace safety, and ergonomics monitoring. It features a high-performance Python backend server combined with a premium React dark-mode dashboard.

The application allows users to perform real-time inference on uploaded office photos or live camera streams, with dynamic model selection between a general-purpose **COCO Pre-trained Model** (80 classes) and a custom **Fine-Tuned Workplace Model** (9 classes).

## System Requirements

- **Python**: Version 3.8 or higher.
- **Node.js**: Version 18 or higher.
- **npm**: Version 9 or higher.
- **Web Camera**: (Optional) For real-time workspace monitoring.

## 1. Setup & Installation

### Step 1.1: Backend Virtual Environment
Navigate to the project root directory and set up a virtual environment containing Python dependencies:

```bash
# Create the virtual environment
python3 -m venv .venv

# Activate the virtual environment
source .venv/bin/activate

# Install required packages
pip install -r backend/requirements.txt
```

### Step 1.2: Download Base COCO Models
Before launching the server, you need to download the base SSD MobileNet V2 weights and configs:

```bash
python backend/download_models.py
```
This utility script downloads:
1. `frozen_inference_graph.pb` (Pre-trained COCO weights)
2. `ssd_mobilenet_v2_coco_2018_03_29.pbtxt` (OpenCV DNN configurations)
3. Saves a local labels mapping file `coco_labels.json`.

### Step 1.3: Frontend Dependencies
Navigate to the frontend folder and install Node.js modules:

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
```

## 2. Workplace Fine-Tuning Pipeline

The pipeline is built to train a specialized detector head for everyday office-based automation. The 9 targeted target classes are:
- `person`, `laptop`, `chair`, `book`, `dining table` (mapped from Open Images `table`), `cell phone`, `cup`, `keyboard`, `mouse`.

### Step 2.1: Exhaustive Data Acquisition
To compile the training dataset, run the downloader script:
```bash
python src/dataset.py
```
* **How it works**: The script downloads the official Google Open Images validation split bounding boxes and metadata, filters them for the 9 targeted office classes, and retrieves images in parallel using `concurrent.futures.ThreadPoolExecutor` (20 worker threads).
* **Console Progress**: Uses `tqdm` to display download speeds, ETA, and progress bars. Bounding box coordinates are saved in normalized `[ymin, xmin, ymax, xmax]` format inside `dataset/annotations.json`.

### Step 2.2: TensorFlow Model Training
Run the training script to train the custom SSD head:
```bash
python src/train.py
```
* **tf.data.Dataset Input Pipeline**: Refactored to adhere to industry-standard deep learning practices. Instead of loading full images into RAM, it streams paths, decodes JPEGs natively, resizes them, and normalizes them in parallel on CPU worker threads using `tf.data.AUTOTUNE` and `.prefetch()`.
* **Architecture**: Freezes the pre-trained `MobileNetV2` feature extractor backbone and appends two custom output heads:
  1. **Classification Head**: Dense layer outputting probability distribution over 9 target classes.
  2. **Bounding Box Head**: Regression layer outputting normalized bounding box coordinates.
* **Loss Function**: Custom MultiBox Loss combining Categorical Crossentropy and Smooth L1 Loss.
* **Result**: Saves the output weights to `dataset/ssd_fine_tuned_head.weights.h5`.

## 3. Running the Application

### Option A: Local Development Mode (Separate Servers)
Run both components concurrently in separate terminals for fast hot-reloading:

* **Start Backend**:
  ```bash
  # Ensure virtual environment is active
  source .venv/bin/activate
  uvicorn backend.app:app --reload --host 127.0.0.1 --port 8000
  ```
* **Start Frontend**:
  ```bash
  cd frontend
  npm run dev
  ```
  Open [http://localhost:5173/](http://localhost:5173/) in your web browser.

### Option B: Production Deployment Mode (Single Server)
FastAPI can serve the React frontend static pages directly:

1. **Build Frontend**:
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   npm run build
   ```
2. **Launch Integrated Server**:
   ```bash
   # From root directory
   uvicorn backend.app:app --host 127.0.0.1 --port 8000
   ```
   Open [http://127.0.0.1:8000/](http://127.0.0.1:8000/) in your browser. The dashboard automatically syncs with the FastAPI detection endpoints.

## 4. Interactive Testing
- **Model Switching**: Toggle between "COCO" and "Fine-Tuned SSD" on the dashboard settings. The backend automatically loads the fine-tuned `.weights.h5` head when the Custom model is requested.
- **Interactive Checklists**: Use the scrollable checklist panel to selectively isolate and display targets (e.g. tracking computer peripheral placement or human presence).
